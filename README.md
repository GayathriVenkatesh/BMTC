# BMTC
The project involves building a business intelligence system for analyzing the service efficiency of BMTC buses. Several key performance indicators (KPIs) like Dispatch Inconsistency, Ridership etc. were identified and the code automates the computation of them. Different excel sheets required for each KPI are generated, which are further used to visualize the data.
